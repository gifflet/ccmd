## Installation

### Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew tap gifflet/ccmd
brew install ccmd
```

### Using Go

```bash
go install github.com/gifflet/ccmd/cmd/ccmd@latest
```

### Download Binary

Download the latest binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/gifflet/ccmd/releases).

```bash
# Example for macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -L https://github.com/gifflet/ccmd/releases/latest/download/ccmd-darwin-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv ccmd /usr/local/bin/
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gifflet/ccmd.git
cd ccmd
make build
sudo make install
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize ccmd in your project

```bash
cd your-project
ccmd init
```

This interactive command guides you through creating a `ccmd.yaml` file for your Claude Code Command project. It will prompt you for metadata about your command and create the necessary `.claude/commands` directory structure.

### 2. Install a command

```bash
# Install from GitHub
ccmd install github.com/user/my-command

# Install specific version
ccmd install github.com/user/my-command@v1.0.0

# Install with custom name
ccmd install github.com/user/my-command --name mc
```

### 3. List installed commands

```bash
ccmd list
```

### 4. Update commands

```bash
# Update specific command
ccmd update my-command

# Update all commands
ccmd update --all
```

### 5. Remove a command

```bash
ccmd remove my-command
```

## Commands

### `ccmd init`
Initialize a new Claude Code Command project by creating the necessary configuration files and directory structure.

```bash
ccmd init
```

This interactive command guides you through setting up a new ccmd project:

- Prompts for command metadata (name, version, description, author, repository, etc.)
- Uses sensible defaults (current directory name for `name`, `1.0.0` for version, `index.md` for entry)
- Shows a preview of the generated `ccmd.yaml` before creating it
- Creates the `.claude/commands` directory structure
- All fields except `name` and `version` are optional

Example session:
```
$ ccmd init
This utility will walk you through creating a ccmd.yaml file.
Press ^C at any time to quit.

name: (my-project) my-command
version: (1.0.0) 
description: A command to automate tasks
author: John Doe
repository: https://github.com/johndoe/my-command
entry: (index.md) 
tags (comma-separated): automation, productivity

About to write to /path/to/ccmd.yaml:

name: my-command
version: 1.0.0
description: A command to automate tasks
author: John Doe
repository: https://github.com/johndoe/my-command
entry: index.md
tags:
  - automation
  - productivity

Is this OK? (yes) 

‚úì Created .claude/commands directory
‚úì Created ccmd.yaml

Your ccmd project has been initialized!
```

### `ccmd install`
Install a command from a Git repository.

```bash
# Basic usage
ccmd install <repository>

# With version
ccmd install <repository>@<version>

# Options

ccmd install github.com/user/cmd --force  # Reinstall
```

### `ccmd list`
List all installed commands.

## Creating Commands

Creating a command for ccmd is simple. Start by running `ccmd init` in your command directory to interactively create the configuration file. Your repository needs:

1. **ccmd.yaml** - Command metadata (created by `ccmd init`)
2. **index.md** - Command instructions for Claude
3. **README.md** - Documentation for users

### Example Command Structure

```
my-awesome-command/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ccmd.yaml          # Command metadata (required)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md           # Command for Claude (required)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # User documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/          # Usage examples
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE           # License file
```

### ccmd.yaml Format

```yaml
name: my-awesome-command
version: 1.0.0
description: Automates awesome tasks in Claude Code
author: Your Name
repository: https://github.com/username/my-awesome-command
entry: index.md  # Optional, defaults to index.md
tags:
  - automation
  - productivity
  - testing
commands:  # Optional
  - other-command@^1.0.0
```

### index.md Example

```markdown
# My Awesome Command

You are an AI assistant helping with task automation. When the user invokes this command, you should:

## Instructions

1. Analyze the current project structure
2. Generate appropriate configuration files
3. Set up the automation pipeline
4. Provide clear feedback to the user

## Parameters

- `--type`: Type of automation (test, build, deploy)
- `--config`: Path to configuration file

## Examples

When user says "setup automation", you should...
```

See our [Command Creation Guide](docs/command-structure.md) for detailed instructions.

## Command Structure

ccmd stores all data in your project's `.claude` directory:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/         # Installed commands
‚îÇ      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {command}/     # Command directory
‚îÇ      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {command}.md   # Command file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
