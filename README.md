Simple command-line tool for managing custom commands in Claude Code. Install and share commands from Git repositories with the ease of a package manager.

## Why ccmd?

Managing custom Claude Code commands across multiple projects can be challenging. ccmd solves this by treating commands as versioned, reusable packages:

- **Keep commands out of your codebase**: Store command definitions (.md files and AI context) in separate repositories, keeping your project repositories clean
- **Version control**: Each command has its own version, allowing you to use different versions in different projects
- **Reusability**: Install the same command in multiple projects without duplication
- **Easy sharing**: Share commands with your team or the community through Git repositories
- **Simple management**: Install, update, and remove commands with familiar package manager semantics

Think of ccmd as "npm for Claude Code commands" - centralize your AI tooling configurations and use them anywhere.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/gifflet/ccmd/cmd/ccmd@latest
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize your project
```bash
cd your-project
ccmd init
```

### 2. Install a demo command
```bash
ccmd install https://github.com/gifflet/hello-world
```

### 3. Use it in Claude Code
```
/hello-world

## Creating Your Own Commands

Creating a command for ccmd is simple. Your repository needs:

1. **ccmd.yaml** - Command metadata (created by `ccmd init`)
2. **index.md** - Command instructions for Claude

### Quick Start

```bash
mkdir my-command && cd my-command
ccmd init  # Creates ccmd.yaml interactively
```

### Example Structure

```
my-command/
├── ccmd.yaml          # Command metadata (required)
└── index.md           # Command for Claude (required)
```

### Example ccmd.yaml

```yaml
name: my-command
version: 1.0.0
description: Automates tasks in Claude Code
author: Your Name
repository: https://github.com/username/my-command
entry: index.md  # Optional, defaults to index.md
```
